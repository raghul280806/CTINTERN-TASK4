TASK 4: PRIVATE BLOCKCHAIN & DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT (500+ WORDS)
Task 4 focused on understanding private blockchain environments and deployment concepts. Unlike public blockchains, private blockchains are controlled networks used mainly by organizations for internal applications. The goal of this task was to understand how blockchain applications can be tested and deployed in private or local environments.
Instead of using public test networks, local blockchain environments such as Remix VM were used. These environments simulate blockchain behavior without requiring real cryptocurrency. This approach allows developers to test contracts safely and efficiently.
Smart contracts from previous tasks were deployed again in the private environment. This demonstrated how the same contract behaves consistently across different environments. The deployment process highlighted the importance of EVM versions, gas limits, and transaction execution.
Testing in a private environment allowed repeated experimentation without cost. Developers could debug errors, analyze logs, and optimize contract logic. This task also introduced tools like Ganache conceptually, which are commonly used in professional blockchain development.
Understanding private blockchain deployment is essential for enterprise use cases such as supply chain management, healthcare records, and internal financial systems. Task 4 helped bridge the gap between learning blockchain theory and applying it in real-world organizational contexts
